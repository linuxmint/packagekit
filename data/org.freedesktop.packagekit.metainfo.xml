    <p>
      PackageKit allows performing simple software management tasks over a DBus interface e.g. refreshing the cache,
      updating, installing and removing software packages or searching for multimedia codecs and file handlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work is done by backends which make use of the package manager shipped by the corresponding distribution.
      Its main benefits are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unified developer and user interface on many distributions</li>
      <li>Fine-grained permission control via PolicyKit</li>
      <li>On-demand installation of missing system components</li>
    </ul>
